# Troubleshooting Guide - Homlee Ayodhya Website

## WhatsApp "API" Issues

### Understanding How WhatsApp Links Work
The WhatsApp buttons use **deep links**, not an API. This is important:

✅ **What works:**
- Opening WhatsApp on mobile devices (Android/iOS)
- Works on desktop if WhatsApp Desktop or WhatsApp Web is set up
- Creates a new chat with pre-filled message

❌ **What doesn't work:**
- Devices without WhatsApp installed
- Some desktop browsers (depends on WhatsApp Desktop setup)
- Users who haven't set up WhatsApp

### Testing WhatsApp Buttons

**On Mobile (Best experience):**
1. Open your website on a smartphone
2. Tap any WhatsApp button
3. Should open WhatsApp app with pre-filled message

**On Desktop:**
- Click WhatsApp button
- Should open WhatsApp Web or prompt to open WhatsApp Desktop
- If nothing happens, WhatsApp isn't configured on that device

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: "Nothing happens when I click"**
- **Solution**: Test on mobile device where WhatsApp is installed
- Desktop users need WhatsApp Desktop or WhatsApp Web active

**Issue: "Opens but no message"**
- **Solution**: Check if the URL is properly formatted
- Current format: `https://wa.me/918004174182?text=...`
- Make sure there are no spaces in the phone number

**Issue: "Wrong phone number"**
- **Solution**: Update the phone number in all components:
  - `src/components/Hero.tsx`
  - `src/components/RoomCard.tsx`
  - `src/components/Contact.tsx`
  - `src/components/StickyWhatsAppButton.tsx`

### WhatsApp Link Format
```
https://wa.me/[COUNTRY_CODE][PHONE_NUMBER]?text=[YOUR_MESSAGE]
```

Example:
```
https://wa.me/918004174182?text=Hi%20Homlee%20Ayodhya!%20I'm%20interested%20in%20booking.
```

**Note:** Spaces are encoded as `%20`, special characters need encoding.

## Contact Form Issues

### Current Form Limitation
The contact form currently:
- ✅ Validates input fields
- ✅ Shows success toast message
- ❌ **Does NOT send emails or save data**

### Why?
Without a backend service, the form can't actually send data anywhere. This is by design to keep the website simple and fast.

### Recommended Solution
**Keep it simple:** Direct all inquiries to WhatsApp (which you're already doing!)

The form serves as a **backup option** for users who prefer forms, but the primary CTA should always be WhatsApp.

### Future Options (if needed)

**Option 1: Google Forms Integration (Simplest)**
- Create a Google Form
- Replace form with a link/embed to Google Form
- You'll receive responses in Google Sheets

**Option 2: Email Service (More complex)**
- Requires backend setup
- Services like SendGrid, EmailJS, or Formspree
- Costs money and requires API keys

**Option 3: Database Backend (Most complex)**
- Would need Lovable Cloud backend
- Store form submissions in database
- You view them in admin panel

### My Recommendation
**For a 4-room boutique stay:** WhatsApp is perfect! 
- Instant communication
- Personal touch
- No technical complexity
- Free
- Works on every device

Most small hotels find WhatsApp more effective than email forms because:
1. Guests get immediate responses
2. Easy back-and-forth conversation
3. Can share photos, location, etc.
4. No "form abandonment" issues

## Performance Tips

### If Website Loads Slowly
1. **Compress images** before uploading (use TinyPNG.com or similar)
2. Images should be under 500KB each
3. The website auto-optimizes, but smaller = faster

### Mobile Experience
- Sticky WhatsApp button appears on mobile only (bottom-right)
- All buttons are touch-friendly (large targets)
- Images load lazily (faster initial load)

## SEO Tips

### Improve Google Rankings
1. **Add more content**: Write detailed descriptions of Ayodhya, nearby temples
2. **Get reviews**: Ask guests to review on Google Maps
3. **Local SEO**: Claim your Google Business Profile
4. **Update meta tags**: In `index.html` (I can help with this)
5. **Add structured data**: Already done for basic hotel info

### Current SEO Status
✅ Proper title and meta description
✅ Schema markup for LocalBusiness
✅ All images have alt text
✅ Semantic HTML structure
✅ Mobile responsive
